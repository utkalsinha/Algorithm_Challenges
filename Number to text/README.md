Algorithm Challenges (Convert number to text)
=============================================

This C plus plus code converts any large number to its text representation.
For example,
if Number = 423145543534554

then

Number in Text = four hundred twenty three million one hundred fourty five thousand five hundred fourty three million five hundred thirty four thousand five hundred fifty four

Code Limit: Integer length <= 19 digits

And if Number = -423145543534554

then

Number in Text = minus four hundred twenty three million one hundred fourty five thousand five hundred fourty three million five hundred thirty four thousand five hundred fifty four
